# Status
Phonoid is still under heavy development with the state of the UI 60% done. Music playback functionality is fully implemented, so you can go and play around with it.
By default, it will scan your music folder `(C:/Users/*Username*/Music)` for audio files. You can't change it just yet (unless you edit the source code.)

Phonoid targets Windows, Linux, and macOS, but for now I'm focusing my attention on Windows and try to optimize it.

# Things to implement
- ~~Music playback functionality (duh)~~ ✓
- ~~Serialization/Marshalling system to save parsed tracks~~ ✓
- Window to view track details (location, album, duration, genre, etc)
- Automatic music library scanning system
- Implement a playlist system
- System that allow the user to 'favourite' a song
- Recently played/History
- Settings UI
- ~~Equalizer UI~~ ✓
- YouTube Playback
- YouTube integration that allow the user to add YouTube tracks as if it's an actual music file
- Search functionality for each tab
- I'll add things as i go on
