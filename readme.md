![Phonoid's User Interface](https://i.ibb.co/HdSC9VV/Phonoid.png)

# About
Phonoid is a desktop music player written in Python + Qt5 solely
with a main purpose of providing a feature-rich music player with simple/minimalistic and cross platform user interface.

# Status
Phonoid is still under heavy development with the state of the UI 20% done and the rest of it still remain
unimplemented. The only reason I put this very unfinished project here is to make me easier to clone and work
on this project on multiple computers.
